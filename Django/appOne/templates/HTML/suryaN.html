    <div id="Pranamasana">
        <h3>1. Pranamasana</h3>
        <p>Also known as prayer pose, Pranamasana is the start of your Surya Namaskar. Stand 
                upright on your mat with your both feet closely aligned. Inhale deeply, expanding 
                your chest and relaxing your shoulders.
        </p>
        <p>While you inhale, raise your arms from the sides. And as you exhale, join your palms 
                together as if praying in front of deity. This is the Pratham Namaskar or first 
                salutation towards the sun.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Hastauttanasana">
        <h3>2. Hastauttanasana</h3>
        <p>Keeping the palms joined in the previous prayer position, breathe in and lift your arms
                 up and bend backwards slightly. Your biceps should lie close to your ears. This posture
                  is to loosen up your body by stretching the entire body backwards, standing at your tip 
                  toes.
        </p>
    </div>
        
    <div id="HastaPadasana">
        <h3>3. Hasta Padasana</h3>
        <p>Now breathe out, and bend forward from the waist. Go down and touch youâ€™re the ground but keeping 
            your spine erect. Do this as your exhale slowly and completely.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div id="AshwaSanchalanasana">
        <h3>4. Ashwa Sanchalanasana</h3>
        <p>Now breathe in, and stretch your body parallely to the ground. Keep your hands to the side, and bring 
            your right knee towards the right part of the chest and let your left leg stretch behind. Look up.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Dandasana">
        <h3>5. Dandasana</h3>
        <p>Now as your inhale, fling your right leg also backwards aligning your entire body parallely to the ground.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="AshtangaNamaskara">
        <h3>6. Ashtanga Namaskara</h3>
        <p>This is also known as giving salutations using eight parts or points. After staying in Dandasana, gently 
            bring down your knees towards the floor and exhale. Now bring your chin to rest on the floor, keep your 
            hops elevated in the air. Hence, your eight parts which are two hands, two knees, chin and chest will 
            rest on the floor while your hip stays elevated in the air.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Bhujangasana">
        <h3>7. Bhujangasana</h3>
        <p>This is also known as Cobra pose. This is simply aligning your chest and torso 90 degrees to the ground, 
            keeping your legs and mid-section flat on the ground. Make sure you use your hands to support your body 
            and are not tempted to transfer your entire weight onto them.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="Parvatasana">
        <h3>8. Parvatasana</h3>
        <p>Again, return to the parvatasana from bhujangasana. Keep your palm and feet where they are, and slowly raise 
            your mid-section. Breathe out as you enter parvatasana.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="AshwaSanchalanasana2">
        <h3>9. Ashwa Sanchalanasana</h3>
        <p>Now from Parvatasana, return to the ashwa sanchalanasana. But this time, we do the opposite of what we did in 
            the 4th step. Procedure- Bring your right foot forward, while resting the left foot behind, at its original 
            position.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="HastaPadasana2">
        <h3>10. Hasta Padasana</h3>
        <p>Now slowly bring your left foot forward, next to the right foot as you exhale. Keeping the position of your 
            hands intact, lift yourself up to slowly enter Hasta Padasana.
        </p>
    </div>


    <div id="Hastauttanasana2">
        <h3>11. Hastauttanasana</h3>
        <p>Now inhale, raise your hands upward, and bend backward to enter Ardha Chakra Asana.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="Pranamaasana2">
        <h3>12. Pranama asana</h3>
        <p>Finally, exhale and stand in a relaxed manner in the namaskara mudra. Feel the positive vibrations in 
            your body. This is how you complete one repetition of Surya Namaskar. Twelve repetitions of this 
            holistic exercise are said to yield maximum benefit.</p>
